Canary is a Chrome extension that uses the Google Vertex AI to scan the websites you visit for extremist content and block them!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
## Option 1 - Download from the Chrome web store.
If you want to use Canary as an end user, I reccomend downloading it from the Chrome webstore.

## Option 2 - Build manually
You will first need to setup a project on ```console.cloud.google.com``` with the Google Vertex AI API and then setup a ```OAuth 2.0```. Once you have done this you should:
1) Download the Github repo
2) Open the ```manifest.json``` and replace the oauth2```client_id``` with your own.

Then, to load your repo: 
4) Open Chrome and go to the Extensions page by entering ```chrome://extensions``` in a new tab.
5) Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
6) Click the Load unpacked button and select the downloaded repository
